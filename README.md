# Snake Game

The title of our project is **Snake Game**.

## Scope of the Software

The Snake Game aims to provide an interactive and visually appealing implementation of the classic Snake arcade game. The software allows players to control a snake on a grid, guiding it to consume food, grow longer, and avoid collisions with walls and its own body. The game provides an engaging user experience with features such as a dynamic grid, snake movement, step scoring, storing the highest score, and a game-over sequence. We have connected it to a database that stores the playerâ€™s name and score.

## Functional Requirements of the Project

1. **Game Initialization and Player Input**  
   The game should prompt the player to enter their name before starting. The entered name should be stored for tracking the player's progress.

2. **Countdown Before Game Start**  
   We have displayed a countdown overlay or message to indicate that the game is about to start. The countdown should be visible for a few seconds before the game begins.

3. **Database Connectivity**  
   The game is connected to a database to store and retrieve player data. Player data includes the player's name, score, and moves.

4. **Player Data Display**  
   It displays the player's name, score, and moves during gameplay.

5. **High Scores**  
   It provides an option to display the high scores from the database. High scores should include player names, scores, and moves.

6. **User Interface Enhancements**  
   We have designed a visually appealing user interface to incorporate player input, countdown, and player data display.
